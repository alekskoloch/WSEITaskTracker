# WSEI Task Tracker üöÄ

**WSEI Task Tracker** is an app designed to help you stay on top of your daily tasks, focusing on tasks for today while still allowing you to view past and future tasks. You can easily add tasks, select their status, add descriptions, and delete tasks as needed.

Once a task is marked as **done**, it will disappear from your daily view but you can toggle its visibility to review what you've accomplished. Completed tasks will be highlighted accordingly.

The app offers **email/password** login and optionally allows you to add your name during registration for a personalized greeting. The calendar dynamically adjusts based on the number of tasks planned for each day ‚Äî the more tasks, the darker the calendar tile. If there are no tasks, the tile will remain white. This approach helps you focus on current tasks without overwhelming details, grounded in psychological principles of minimizing distractions.
